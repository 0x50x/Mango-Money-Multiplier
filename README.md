it's a funding arbitrage bot for mangomarkets

0. you must have a Solana private key in id.json in a few spots, and in ~/.config/solana/id.json. it's a mess, I know
1. replace meAndThePeeps with the publickeys of wallets you wish to trade (not Mango account pubkeys) and replace any instance of https://solana--devnet.datahub.figment.io/apikey/24c64e276fc5db6ff73da2f59blolkek with your own private RPC. notably it won't even work with the one here if you don't change it ;) ctrl+shift+h change everywhere :)
2. run sudo docker-compose up --build
3. voila


I went on an absolute hunch and got it working on devnet.2 :)


@mangomarkets plz sers can we have some market makers running on devnet cuz otherwise shit be ridiculous lol

## Important

1. Risk only what you can afford to lose.
2. Trading at leverage is extremely risky, and there is a chance you may lose all your funds.
3. In no way do I or any other party imply let alone assure results.
4. Historical data is no indication of future activity.
5. This is extremely alpha software, largely undocumented and completely without tests or helpful comments. Use at your own risk.
6. Nothing I do or say should ever be misconstrued as financial advice.
